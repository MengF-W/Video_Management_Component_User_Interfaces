# Overall Idea
![screen4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d8663e8-871f-4e98-a48c-df2eb1315096)
The idea is to flow a process for the video management. 

# Video_Management_Component_User_Interfaces

The Video Management Component User Interfaces act as an interaction place between front-end and the Video Management Component. At the moment, a MotionJPEG(MJPEG) video streaming url can be played and a short video footage can be recorded and saved.
